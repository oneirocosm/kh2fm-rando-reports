### Checks
Sora's heart refers to the checks discovered by leveling Sora.  This does not cover every level Sora obtains and can additionally vary based on the randomizer Leveling settings selected.

#### Level 1
If Leveling is set to Level 1, no checks are available.

#### Level 50
If Leveling is set to Level 50, there will be 23 checks with one appearing at each of the following levels: 2, 4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20, 23, 25, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 39, 41, 44, 46, 48, 50

#### Level 99
If Leveling is set to Level 99, there will be 23 checks with one appearing at each of the following levels: 7, 9, 12, 15, 17, 20, 23, 25, 28, 31, 33, 36, 39, 41, 44, 47, 49, 53, 59, 65, 73, 85, 99

### The Choice of Sword, Shield, or Staff
While the choice of sword, shield, or staff does not affect what checks will be on levels, it does affect the order in which they are received.  This can be useful in co-op runs where different players select different objects.  Here's how your choice affects the order of checks received:

| Sword (50) | Shield (50) | Staff (50) | Sword (99) | Shield (99) | Staff (99) |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:----------:|

| 4          | 10          | 2          | 9          | 17          | 7          |

### Level Ability Codes
While the same set of checks is generated by the randomizer, it is technically possible to use a different set of checks for each item chosen.  The ID for each ability gained from leveling is as follows:
{% levelCheckIdTable levels %}
