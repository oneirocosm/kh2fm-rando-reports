### Critical Mode Checks
When Final Mix was realeased, Critical Mode was added as a new challenge for players.  While Sora does take more damage in this mode and gains resources slower, he also deals more damage and has access to 7 extra abilites at the start of the game.  Turning on Critical Mode in the randomizer includes these 7 checks in the randomization process.

### Warning
If you intend to play on a mode other than Critical, it is important that these checks be turned off.  If this is left on and another difficulty is selected, it will be impossible to access these checks.  As a result, if something important is on these checks, it may be impossible to finish the game.
