### What are Drive Forms?
Drive Forms are your anime-style transformations that allow you to use powerful techniques you don't normally have access to. When you use a form (other than Limit Form), one or more of your party members will disappear and you will gain a powerful yet specialized moveset based off of which form you entered.  By performing certain tasks while in a form, you can level that form to make it more powerful and receive a check.  The Drive Forms are as follows:

#### Valor Form
Valor Form is a form focused on melee attacks.  It is impossible to use magic while in this form, but combos are increased.  Additionally, your run speed is increased, and you can jump higher.  Entering the form requires Goofy to be conscious in your party and uses up 3 bars in the Drive Gauge.  This form gains experience every time Sora successfully hits an enemy while in Valor Form.

#### Wisdom Form
Wisdom Form is a form focused on magic use.  Your keyblade strikes are replaced with projectile attacks, and magic is considerably more powerful.  Additionally, you slide on the ground and have access to the Quick Run ability.  Entering the form requires Donald to be conscious in your party and uses up 3 bars in the Drive Gauge.  This form gains experience with every Heartless Sora defeats while in Wisdom Form.

#### Limit Form
Limit Form is a Final Mix addition that gives Sora access to his Kingdom Hearts I moveset.  Your shortcuts are replaced with unique moves that require magic.  Additionally, you gain access to Dodge Roll.  This form does not require a specific party member but uses up 4 bars in the Drive Gauge.  This form gains experience every time a Limit Command is finished while in Limit Form.

#### Master Form
Master Form is a form that allows both melee and magic combat.  It is especially useful for aerial combat and stringing together large combos.  Additionally, you gain access to Aerial Dodge.  This form requires both Donald and Goofy to be conscious in your party and uses up 4 bars in the Drive Gauge.  This form gains experience when Sora collects Drive Orbs while in Master Form.

#### Final Form
Final Form is a form that allows very powerful melee and magic combat.  While in this form, sora gains access to powerful finishers and the Glide ability.  This form requires both Donald and Goofy to be conscious in your party and uses up 5 bars in the Drive Gauge.  This form gains experience with every Nobody Sora defeats while in Final Form.

#### Anti Form
Anti Form is a unique form as you do not enter it in the same way as the other forms.  Every time Sora enters Valor, Wisdom, Limit, or Master Form, there is a chance that you will enter Anti Form instead.  While in Anti Form, Sora takes on a dark Form that has no magic and attacks viscously without using a keyblade.  Unlike other forms, it cannot be exited from the menu in the middle of battle and will use up the entire remaining Drive Gauge.

While entering Anti Form is random, it is possible to influence that chance.  Essentially, there is a resource called Anti Points which controls the probability of entering the form.  Anti Points follow the following rules:

| Condition         | Change to Points |
|:-----------------:|:----------------:|
| Enter Valor Form  | +1               |
| Enter Wisdom Form | +1               |
| Enter Limit Form  | +1               |
| Enter Wisdom Form | +1               |
| Enter Final Form  | -10              |
| Enter Anti Form   | -5               |
| Force Final Form  | No Change        |
| Obtain a New Form | Set to 0         |

Note that Anti Points cannot go below 0.

Depending on the number of Anti Points and where you are, the probability of entering Anti Form is as follows:

| Location              | 0-4 Anti Points | 5-9 Anti Points | 10+ Anti Points |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Outside of Battle     | 0%              | 0%              | 0%              |
| Pete Battle           | 0%              | 0%              | 0%              |
| Barbossa Battle       | 0%              | 0%              | 0%              |
| Hades Battle          | 0%              | 0%              | 0%              |
| 1000 Heartless Battle | 0%              | 0%              | 0%              |
| Normal Battle         | 0%              | 10%             | 25%             |
| Scripted Battle       | 0%              | 20%             | 50%             |
| Org Member Battle     | 0%              | 50%             | 100%            |
| Armored Xemnas        | 0%              | 100%            | 100%            |

### Growth Ability Checks
In the base game of Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix, leveling up a drive form grants an ability related to that drive form.  In the randomizer, this has been expanded so leveling up a drive form can provide you with various checks.  As with the base game, in order to level forms higher, more forms need to be unlocked.

| Number of Forms Found | Max Form Level |
|:---------------------:|:--------------:|
| 0                     | 2              |
| 1                     | 3              |
| 2                     | 4              |
| 3                     | 5              |
| 4                     | 6              |
| 5                     | 7              |

Note that it is possible to level a form using the various auto form abilities, but those abilities do not contribute to the number of forms found.  There is a total of 36 checks available on Drive Forms--6 for each form.

### Forcing Final Form
In the randomizer, Final Form is as a check, but this wasn't always true.  In the original Kingdom Hearts 2 (and Final Mix), it was possible to obtain Final Form after beating Roxas.  Once you reached this point in the game, every time Sora entered Anti Form, there was a 1 in 6 chance he would enter and unlock Final Form instead.  As getting Sora into Anti Form is time-consuming, Final Mix added an ability called Light and Darkness which forced Sora into Anti Form if it was possible.  This made obtaining Final Form significantly easier.  In the randomizer, Final Form can be obtained in this way from the start.  This means that players can spend the time commitment to force it without Light and Darkness as soon as they find their first drive form.  And if they have the Light and Darkness ability in addition to that, it makes it that much easier.

### Game ID
Here are the ID's the pnach file uses to replace Drive Form Checks:

| Level | Valor    | Wisdom   | Limit    | Master   | Final    |
|:-----:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| 2     | 11D1A22E | 11D1A266 | 11D1A29E | 11D1A2D6 | 11D1A30E |
| 3     | 11D1A236 | 11D1A26E | 11D1A2A6 | 11D1A2DE | 11D1A316 |
| 4     | 11D1A23E | 11D1A276 | 11D1A2AE | 11D1A2E6 | 11D1A31E |
| 5     | 11D1A246 | 11D1A27E | 11D1A2B6 | 11D1A2EE | 11D1A326 |
| 6     | 11D1A24E | 11D1A286 | 11D1A2BE | 11D1A2F6 | 11D1A32E |
| 7     | 11D1A256 | 11D1A28E | 11D1A2C6 | 11D1A2FE | 11D1A336 |

### Development Keyblades
As an added bonus, whenever you get a Valor, Master, or Final Form, the secondary keyblade equipped by default will be a development keyblade that was not used in the final game.  They are:
| Form   | Keyblade                            |
|--------|-------------------------------------|
| Valor  | FAKE / ID Not Found / Kingdom Key W |
| Master | Detection Saber                     |
| Final  | Edge of Ultima                      |
