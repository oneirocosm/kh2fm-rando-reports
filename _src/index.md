## Alpha Version (Under Construction)
This is a site dedicated to providing tips and tricks for the Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix Randomizer.  This includes various Check Locations and tips for overcoming some of the more difficult parts of the game.

### KH2FM Randomizer
The Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix Randomizer allows you to play through the Garden of Assemblage Mod of KH2FM with all of the various items and abilites mixed up.  Unlike other randomizers, where you tend to be trying to find the next piece to progress, this one tends to be quite open-ended and more focused on the builds and strategies you are able to use with a limited moveset.  For more information, take a look at [the website](https://randomizer.valaxor.com/#/seed) or [the Discord](https://discord.gg/GcJR7Fv).  Thanks to [Valaxor](https://twitter.com/valaxor) for creating the randomizer.

### Garden of Assemblage Mod
This is a mod of Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix created by [sonicshadowsilver2](https://twitter.com/Sonicshadowsil2).  It utilizes the cheat engine of the PCSX2 emulator to use the Garden of Assemblage room (where the Data Battles were located) as a way to access each individual world without the Gummy Ship.  The goal of the Mod is to collect all three proofs (The Proof of Connection, The Proof of Peace, and The Proof of Nonexistence) which will allow you to unlock and confront the final boss.  You can donate to the creator of the mod [here](https://streamlabs.com/sonicshadowsilver2/tip).

### Notes
- This site is a still a work in progress.  A lot of the concrete information has been added, but there is a lot of work to do with explaining tips and formatting everything.
- I'm currently using a lot of markdown for the pages, and I'm struggling a bit with the limitations around it.
- Currently using eleventy to generate the site
