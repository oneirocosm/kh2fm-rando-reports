pageName: "Radiant Garden"
blurb: "Also known as Hollow Bastion, this original Kingdom Hearts World that is home to many of the Final Fantasy characters Sora encounters throughout his journeys.  Originally the home to Ansem the Wise and his disciples, this world was plunged into darkness by experiments gone awry.  While Sora was able to restore much of the world, it still has a long way to go until it is completely recovered.  And in addition to the lingering forces of darkness, it would seem the Organization has a hold on this world as well.  Can it possibly survive the clash between the two?"

### Tips
- The fights in the final hallway of the Cavern of Remembrance (the area before the Garden of Assemblage) are guaranteed to not have important checks.
- Certain areas in the Cavern of Remembrance are limited by your movement options; however, it is possible to bypass some of these with tricks
- The 1000 Heartless Battle is a great place to level Limit Form--especially if you have MP Rage.
- After completing the 1000 Heartless Battle, a few checks open up that are a little out of the way.  One is a chest located in the Heartless Manufactory and the other requires you to talk to Yuna at the Postern.
- The Mushroom XIII check is only available if you already have the Proof of Peace.
- After fighting Sephiroth, you do not need to walk back to town and talk to Cloud.  Instead, you just need to re-enter the area where Sephiroth is.
