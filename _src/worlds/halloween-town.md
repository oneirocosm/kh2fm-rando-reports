### Tips
- This world is a popular early choice as it is possible to reach all of the chests after only one required fight.
- On Critical Mode, it is usually faster to lose the first encounter in the Halloween Town Plaza.
- The required fight in the Christmas Town Plaza is difficult at early levels.  Jack's limit is incredibly useful for clearing it without too much trouble.
- The Oogie Boogie fight has been modified so it can be completed in one cycle.
- For the second encounter in the Halloween Town Plaza (where you are collecting presents), use Jack's limit immediately for a quick clear.
- The Vexen Absent Silhouette disappears temporarily if you lose to it.  To get it to return, leave the room and enter again.
