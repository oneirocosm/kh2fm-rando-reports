pageName: "Disney Castle"
blurb: "This world is the home of many classic Disney characters, including Sora's companions Donald and Goofy.  As a stronghold of light that repels darkness, Disney Castle is usually a world free of meddling from the Heartless.  But in the face of Maleficent's and Pete's nefarious actions, this world faces a new threat like never before.  Fixing it will not be as simple as bashing some Heartless over the head--in fact--it may require visiting the origin of the world itself."

### Tips
- This is a good world to enter early as most of the checks are very easy to access.
- The Minnie escort mission is a good source of XP--especially early on.
- Travelling back and Forth between Disney Castle and Timeless River resets the drive guage, making it quicker to level here.  In fact, it's a great place to level Wisdom Form and Valor Form and a decent place to level Limit Form.
- The Lingering Will superboss only becomes available if you already have the Proof of Connection.  As a result, the Lingering Will never has the Proof of Connection.
