blurb: "The world where the Disney film \"Tron\" takes place.  Well, technically if you get into the lore, it's a copy of the original ENCOM version of that world, but the events play out similarly regardless.  In this world, computer programs take human form in the image of their Users.  Sora, Donald, and Goofy team up with a program named Tron and assist him on his quest to destroy the Master Control Program--a program deadset on creating Heartless and using them to take over Hollow Bastion."

### Tips
- The third wave of the Dataspace minigame is a great place to level up if you have EXP Boost equipped--especially when paired with magnet splash or Chicken Little.  To level quickly, get below half health and use the reaction command on two of the terminals.  At this point, Heartless will spawn endlessly until you interact with the final terminal or time runs out.  Make sure to save enough time to interact with the terminal at the end or you will have to repeat the process.
