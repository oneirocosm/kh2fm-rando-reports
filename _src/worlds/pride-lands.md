### Tips
- A lot of players choose to visit this world first as it has 26 checks immediately after the first fight and it does not depend on human movement options.
- The randomizer has been modified so lion sora begins with the dash ability.
- The first fight is difficult at a low level.  Landing an arial hit and then mashing square for the corkscrew attack is usually the best option.  Reaction commands can help as well.
- Once you reach the oasis, you can immediately leave and then talk to Simba to get him to join your party and give you a check.
