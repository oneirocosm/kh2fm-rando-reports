### Tips
- This world is unique in that it is the only world where you play as Roxas.  This leads to a few quality-of-life issues that are not encountered in the other worlds.  Because of this, it is highly recommended that you make a save state before entering Simulated Twilight Town as the following scenarios can softlock your game:
    - Casting magic as Roxas.  In order to prevent this, the game turns off magic shortcuts when you enter the world.  Note that magic can be cast in the air as Roxas recovers from his T-pose when he hits the ground, but it is definitely not recommended.
    - Dodge rolling as Roxas.  In order to prevent this, the game turns off dodge roll when you enter the world.  Note that it is perfectly safe to dodge roll if you are in Limit Form.
    - Using Trinity Limit as Roxas
    - Jumping on a skateboard while in Limit Form
    - Being in Limit Form during Twilight Thorn's reaction command
- There is a glitch that occasionally causes you to lose your equipped keyblade and have it replaced with a second Kingdom Key.  This is random.  For this reason, it is recommended to either enter this world with a Kingdom Key or unimportant keyblade equipped.
- This world is also unique in that it must be played through almost entirely before you can leave.  For this reason, most players tend to put off visiting this world until later.
- It is possible to leave this world before the second Axel Fight by using the save point near the computer.  However, if you do leave early and then visit regular Twilight Town for the first time, it is possible to softlock your game as Sora will be unable to progress or leave.
- Limit Form is very useful for this world--especially during the Struggle tournament and Twilight Thorn fights.  It is very common to see players user Ragnarok in an attempt to end Struggle battles quickly.
- Like regular Twilight Town, there are a few large areas that really benefit from having movement options like quick run and glide available.  These are slightly awkward to use as Roxas due to a lack of animations, but they are safe despite that.
- Chest management is very important if you are first learning this world as these chests do not appear in Jiminy's Journal.  In particular, once you reach Sunset Terrace, it is important to remember to immediately go back to Central Station to get the three chests there.
- If you miss the chest in the Station of Calling, you can get it on the way to fight Data Roxas.
- If you miss the three chests in Central Station, you can go back after completing this world.
- It is impossible to miss the chest in the Station of Serenity.
