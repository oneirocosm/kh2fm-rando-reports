pageName: "Garden of Assemblage"
blurb: "The hubworld for the \"Garden of Assemblage\" Mod.  In the base game, it was originally located at the end of the Cavern of Remembrance in Hollow Bastion/Radiant Garden and gave access to the data battles.  In the mod, it has been repurposed so the boss portals give access to each world, allowing you to travel to each of them without the Gummi Ship."

### Chests
There are 3 total chests in the Garden of Assemblage.  All are in the center of the room, but you must interact with the console in the center to get the third to appear.  Note that in Jiminy's Journal, these chests will appear in Hollow Bastion / Radiant Garden.

### Other Checks
There are no other checks in the Garden of Assemblage.

### Tips
- If you have the promise charm and all three proofs, you can interact with the center console to take you to the final boss via the Station of Awakening.
- In the Station of Awakening, there are several Bulky Vendor heartless which allow Sora to quickly level-up via a reaction command.  These continue to respawn if you leave the area and return.
- Each world's portal will appear blue until its last visit has been completed.  Note that this includes the Lingering Will superboss for Disney Castle regardless of if its inclusion in the randomizer.
- The Struggle Tournament Referee is located across from the save point and will sell you items.
