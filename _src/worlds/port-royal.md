### Tips
- Magic is incredibly useful in this world--especially blizzard.  In fact, most players tend to put off this world until they get blizzard.
- Chicken Little is a very useful summon as his magnet effect can pull pirates into areas with moonlight, allowing you to damage them.
- Be mindful of shadowy areas as pushing pirates into them with your attacks will make them immune until they enter moonlight again.
