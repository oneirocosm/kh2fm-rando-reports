### Tips
* After beating the Heartless in the treasure room, immediately get the two chests before leaving.  If you don't, you will have to backtrack to reach this point.
- On Critical Mode, it is usually faster to die in the first fight of the world.
- None of the checks in the second visit can be reached unless Sora has at least one Fire, Blizzard, and Thunder element.
- After completing the second visit, the Mushroom XIII member in the treasure room is a great place to level Valor Form.
