### Tips
- This world has a lot of empty space, so most players prefer to put this off until they have a faster form of movement such as quick run or glide.
- The first visit to Twilight Town must be played out entirely before leaving.
- The large quanitity of Nobodies in this world make it a good place to level Final Form.
- With a drive converter or two, the reaction commands from the Gambler Nobodies in the mansion are a good way to farm Drive Orbs for leveling Master Form.
- During the third visit, once the beam in the mansion has been activated, touching it will cause Sora to regain his Drive Gauge.
