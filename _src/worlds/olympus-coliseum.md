blurb: "The world where the Disney film \"Hercules\" takes place.  In the year since Sora last visited, Hercules has found himself pushed to his limits by Hades various attempts at taking over.  It's a tall task, but maybe Sora and his friends have the strength to remind Herc what makes a True Hero.  And maybe they even have the strength to become True Heroes themselves."
