blurb: "This world is home to Winnie the Pooh and his friends.  Following his last visit in Kingdom Hearts I, a Heartless attack on Merlin's home have scattered the pages of this book to the wind and, as a result, Pooh has lost his memory of his friends.  It's up to Sora to collect the missing Torn Pages and complete the book and restore his friend's memories."

### Tips
- Some of the minigames have been sped up in the randomizer.  This is normal.
- In the Spooky Cave, Bees will not spawn if Sora is in the air.
- You keep the items you found if you leave the Spooky Cave early via the menu.
- Other than at Pooh's House, none of the other checks in this world can be Torn Pages.
