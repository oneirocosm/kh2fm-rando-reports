### Tips
- The summit fight is a great place to level Limit Form--especially if you have MP Rage equipped.
- It is possible to get in the throne room before the Shan Yu fight with the proper equipment and the following steps:
    - Stand at the the top of the stairs, just before the cutscene trigger, and jump.
    - At the peak of your jump, air dodge away from the cutscene trigger.
    - At the top of that jump, enter master form and air dodge toward the cutscene trigger.  You should be able to jump over it.
    - While falling, spam fire to delay your fall as you move toward the palace door.  If you don't have fire, reflect might work as well.
    - Enter the palace cooridor while falling.  You can now proceed to the throne room normally to access the chests there.
    - Once you leave, walk up to the top of the stairs to continue the world normally.
- Mulan's Red Rocket Limit is useful and shouldn't be overlooked.
