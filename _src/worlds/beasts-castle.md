### Tips
- The Heartless fight in the parlor is a good place to level Wisdom Form if you are lucky enough to get it before this point.
- Do not equip Combo Boosts during the minigame where you are trying to light the torches.  If anything, negative combo is useful there.
- Beast's Limit is very powerful and definitely worth using--especially if you are low on other tools.
