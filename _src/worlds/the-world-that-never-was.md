### Tips
- Returning to the Alley to Between resets the Drive Gauge.  This makes this world a great place to level Wisdom Form or force Final Form.  It is also a decent spot for leveling Valor Form and Limit Form.
- Most players wait to progress in this world until they have Quick Run and sometimes scan as this makes it fairly easy to beat Roxas.
- If the Promise Charm is turned off, this world is mandatory as the only way to fight the final boss will be to access the final door with the three proofs.
- Even if the Promise Charm is turned on, it is possible that it will be located somewhere within this world.
- Stitch tends to be useful for getting the chests in Ruin and Creation's Passage.
