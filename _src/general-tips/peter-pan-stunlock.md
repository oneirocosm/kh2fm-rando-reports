pageName: Peter Pan Stunlock
---

### General Description
This is a technique that allows Sora to stunlock certain ground-based bosses.  It works by repeatedly using an aerial attack while the Peter Pan summon is in use.  As Pan attacks just after Sora does, repetedly performing the attack will lock the boss in place and prevent them from retliating.  If done correctly, the boss will continue to take hits until they have 1 HP remaining, and a finisher can be used to end the fight.

### Downsides
While the technique is easy to perform, finding the Peter Pan summon can be a challenge.  That said, if found, it can make particular bosses much easier (and sometimes faster) to defeat.  That being said, it is often faster to fight the boss the normal way.

### Requires
- Feather Charm (Peter Pan summon)

### Optional
- Scan
- High Jump turned off
- Aerial Spiral
- Aerial Dive (if Aerial Spiral is not available)

### Execution
This stunlock is relatively easy to perform.  First, Peter Pan must be summoned using the feather charm.  After that, jump in the air and attack the boss with a regular aerial attack.  Peter Pan will follow up by immediately attacking afterward and continue to stun the boss.  As soon as Sora lands (or slightly before due to input buffering), jump again and repeat the process.  The repeated action of Sora and Peter Pan attacking will lock the boss in place.  Additionally, as you are hitting attacks so frequently, the summon bar will continue to fill which prevents peter pan from disappearing.  Once the boss reaches 1 HP (you may need to guess if you don't have Scan), finish out a combo or use magic to finish off the boss.

### Tips
- While Scan is not strictly necessary in this fight, it makes it clear when the boss is at 1 HP and can be finished.  Without it, you will have to guess.  If you guess to early, the boss will escape the stunlock.  If you guess too late, you still finish the fight but later than you would have otherwise.  If you have to guess, guessing later is usually better.
- If High Jump is turned on, it is easy to jump over the boss.  However, it is still possible to perform if you lightly press the jump button.
- Aerial Spiral makes it easier to move long distances in the air to reach the boss.  It is recommended you equip it if available.
- Aerial Dive also makes it easier to hit the boss at a distance, but it does not work as well as Aerial Spiral.  If Aerial Spiral is not an option and Aerial Dive is available, it is recommended you equip it instead.
- If you die while Peter Pan is summoned, Tinkerbell can revive you one time.
