pageName: Final Form Firaga
---

### General Idea
While in Final Form, Firaga (and the other fire spells to a lesser extent) can wreck havok on both enemies and bosses.  Additionally, by repeatedly using this without using a finisher, a boss will be stunlocked and take a ton of damage.

### Requires
- Final Form
- Fire, Fira, or Firaga

### Optional
- Elixir
- Mega-Elixir
- Ether
- Mega-Ether
- Combo Plus
- Fire Boost

### Execution
To do this in regualar combat, just use Firaga (or equivalent) while in Final Form.  To use this against a boss, move up next to a boss and enter Final Form.  The initial transformation will knock the boss in the air and initially stun them.  Then, move next to the boss and repeatedly use Firaga (or equivalent) and pausing for a couple seconds if the next attack would be a finisher.  When you are almost out of MP, use an item to recover it.  Repeat until Final Form wears off or the boss fight ends.

### Tips
- If you struggle with menuing, it's useful to make a shortcut for the item you're using
- Equipping a Combo Plus will allow you to attack with Firaga one additional time before pausing for a couple seconds.  Equipping more Combo Plus abilities will allow more attacks.
- Equipping Fire Boost abilities will increase your fire damage output.

### Uses
This can be used on any ground-based human-sized enemies including bosses.  It is especially useful against Vexen and Zexion.
