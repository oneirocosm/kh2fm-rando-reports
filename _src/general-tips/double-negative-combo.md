pageName: Double Negative Combo Stunlock
---

### General Description
This is a technique that allows Sora to stunlock certain ground-based bosses.  It works by repeatedly jumping and attacking the boss with the standard aerial finisher (no additional aerial finishers equipped)---allowing no time for the boss to recover between attacks.  If done correctly, the boss will continue to take hits until the health bar is completely depleted and will not be able to attack at all.

### Downsides
While this stunlock is relatively easy to perform, it is difficult to get both of the negative combos required to perform it as there are only two in the game.  If both Negative Combo abilities are on different keyblades, this technique cannot be used as standard Sora cannot weild both and the Drive Forms that allow this have additional abilities that interfere.  Also, while the technique is not difficult, it is slower than fighting the boss outright.

### Requires
- Negative Combo (x2)
- Aerial Finish turned off
- Air Combo Plus turned off
- Magnet Splash (Magnet Burst) turned off

### Optional
- High Jump turned off
- Aerial Spiral
- Aerial Dive (if Aerial Spiral is not available)

### The Negative Combo Ability
Negative Combo is an ability that decreses the number of hits in a combo by 1.  This is useful as it allows Sora to reach his finisher quicker than normal.  As a standard combo has 3 hits, equipping two of these allow you to access your finisher immediately.  This effect is canceled out by the Air Combo Plus ability (while Sora is in the air), so those must be turned off to access the finisher immediately.  This ability can exist as a standalone ability or attached to a keyblade.

### Aerial Finishers
While Aerial Finish and Magnet Splash are more powerful than the standard aerial finisher, neither can be used here as they take too long and will allow the enemy to recover.  For this reason, if they have been obtained, they must be turned off for the stunlock to work.

### Execution
In order to perform this stunlock, it is first necessary to stunlock the boss.  This can be done with the aerial attack used in the combo, but other attacks work as well.  Once the boss has been stunlocked, make sure you are locked on, jump in the air, and perform one aerial attack.  With both Negative Combos on, Sora will immediately perform the standard aerial finisher and keep the boss in the stunlock.  As soon as Sora hits the ground (or slightly before as inputs are buffered), jump again and repeat the process.  Continue until the boss is defeated.

### Tips
- High Jump makes this stunlock much more difficult as it is easy to jump over the Boss' head.  I recommend turning it off, but if you forget to, it is still possible to do the combo by lightly tapping the jump button instead of holding it down.
- Aerial Spiral makes it easier to move long distances in the air to reach the boss.  It is recommended you equip it if available.
- Aerial Dive also makes it easier to hit the boss at a distance, but it does not work as well as Aerial Spiral.  If Aerial Spiral is not an option and Aerial Dive is available, it is recommended you equip it instead.
- Certain arenas make this stunlock more difficult.  In certain cases, you will want to hit the enemy away from the edges of the arena to reduce the chance that they will break out of the stunlock.  This is especially true for Demyx, Vexen, and Lingering Will's arenas.
- Unlike other stunlocks, scan is not necessary here as you attack with a finisher every time.  That said, it does give you some peace of mind to know that you are actually making progress.
