Roxas, the Key of Destiny, is the 13th member of Organization XIII.  He is Sora's Nobody and serves as the first boss fight in The World that Never was.  He also has a data version located in the egg room of Simulated Twilight Town which is significantly more difficult.

### The Quick Run Cheese
This technique allows the player to stunlock Roxas in a combo that will lower him to 1 HP.  It uniquely works on Roxas, is easy to perform and only requires the Quick Run ability.  The Scan ability and removing Dodge Roll make the technique significantly easier to perform.  To perform it, first you need to avoid Roxas until he activates his "The End" minigame.  Then, you have to win the game, by quickly selecting "The End" in the menu as soon as it appears.  If you do this quickly enough, Sora will steal Roxas' keyblades and they will hover behind him.  From here, perform one or two combos to push Roxas to the edge of the arena.  Then, repeatedly Quick Run into the wall next to Roxas.  Each time you Quick Run, the two levitating keyblades will attack Roxas in a way that does not allow him to retaliate.  If Dodge Roll is turned off, this is very easy as you can tap the button to Quick Run instead of rolling.  Continue this until Roxas is at 1 HP (or at least close enough to finish in one attack) and perform a finisher.  This technique is particularly slow, but it's by far the easiest one to do.

### Double Negative Combo
It is possible to defeat Roxas using the [Double Negative Combo Stunlock](/general-tips/double-negative-combo-stunlock/).  One of the easiest ways to enter the stunlock is to Reflect one of Roxas' attack.  If reflect is not an option, it is possible to initially stun him by winning the "The End" minigame.
